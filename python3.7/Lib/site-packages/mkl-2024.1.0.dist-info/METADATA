Intel速 oneAPI Math Kernel Library (Intel速 oneMKL) is a computing math library of highly optimized, extensively threaded routines for applications that require maximum performance. This package provides C and Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) programming language interfaces. Intel MKL C language interfaces can be called from applications written in either C or C++, as well as in any other language that can reference a C interface. Use it to optimize code for current and future generations of Intel速 CPUs and GPUs.
